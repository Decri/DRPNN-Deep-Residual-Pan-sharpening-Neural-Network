# DRPNN-Deep-Residual-Pan-sharpening-Neural-Network
# This is the source code of the DRPNN proposed in the journal article:
# Y. Wei, Q. Yuan, H. Shen and L. Zhang, "Boosting the Accuracy of Multispectral Image Pansharpening by Learning a Deep Residual Network," in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, vol. 14, no. 10, pp. 1795-1799, Oct. 2017.
# Currently, only two trained models (for separately pan-sharpening 4-banded and 8-banded images) are rewritten into Matlab files and released.
